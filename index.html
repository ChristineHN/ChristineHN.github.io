            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I am originally from South Korea but moved to Hollywood, Maryland back in 2011, and came to Chicago for
                college in 2015. I love golfing, camping, and bouldering. Eventhough I don't have much experience in
                HTML and CSS, I am looking forward to learn new skills in this class.</p>
